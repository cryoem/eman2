helpstring="""Hello and welcome to EMAN2 !

EMAN2 is NOT a single central graphical program, but includes a large set of programs both graphical and command-line. 

If you are just getting started with EMAN2, here are some tips:

1) If you are just interested in using the image browser and other display programs, simply run e2display.py
2) If you want to use EMAN2 for single particle reconstruction, make an empty folder, 'cd' into that folder, then run e2projectmanager.py
3) If you want to use EMAN2 for file format conversions, simple image processing, etc. here are some programs to run to get started:
	* e2proc2d.py --help
	* e2proc3d.py --help
	* e2help.py processors
	* e2help.py processors -v 2
	* e2display.py

4) Please consider going through a simple tutorial available at: http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/Tutorials
