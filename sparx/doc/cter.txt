CTF Estimation: Automated estimation of CTF parameters with error assessment, including Volta phase shift.

\\
===== Usage =====

Usage in command line

  sxcter.py  input_image_path  output_directory  --selection_list=SELECTION_TEXT_FILE  --wn=CTF_WINDOW_SIZE --apix=PIXEL_SIZE  --Cs=CS  --voltage=VOLTAGE  --ac=AMP_CONTRAST  --f_start=FREA_START  --f_stop=FREQ_STOP  --kboot=KBOOT  --overlap_x=OVERLAP_X  --overlap_y=OVERLAP_Y  --edge_x=EDGE_X  --edge_y=EDGE_Y  --check_consistency  --stack_mode  --debug_mode  --vpp  --defocus_min=DEFOCUS_MIN  --defocus_max=DEFOCUS_MAX  --defocus_step=DEFOCUS_STEP  --phase_min=PHASE_MIN    --phase_max=PHASE_MAX  --phase_step==PHASE_STEP  --pap

\\
===== Typical usage =====

sxcter exists in for both MPI and non-MPI versions (Running MPI version does not require --MPI flag). 
\\ The program supports the phase shift estimation which induced by phase plate (e.g. Volta Phase Plate) with --vpp option. Please note that cter stores the estimated phase shift as amplitude contrast. By default, amplitude is used for the CTF model fitting but user can select power spectrum with --pap option (traditional method).

\\ __All Micrographs Mode - Process all micrographs in a directory:__
\\ Specify a list of input micrographs using a wild card (*), here called input micrographs path pattern. Running from the command line requires enclosing the string by single quotes (\') or double quotes (\"). sxgui.py will automatically adds single quotes to the string. bdb files cannot be selected as input micrographs. Then, specify output directory where all outputs should be saved. In this mode, all micrographs matching the path pattern will be processed.

  mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py './mic*.hdf' outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0

\\ __Selected Micrographs Mode - Process all micrographs in a selection list file:__
\\ In addition to input micrographs path pattern and output directry arguments, specify a name of micrograph selection list text file using --selection_list option (e.g. output of sxgui_unblur.py or sxgui_cter.py). The file extension must be ".txt". In this mode, only micrographs in the selection list which matches the file name part of the pattern (ignoring the directory paths) will be processed. If a micrograph name in the selection list does not exists in the directory specified by the micrograph path pattern, processing of the micrograph will be skipped.

  mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py './mic*.hdf' outdir_cter --selection_list=mic_list.txt --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0

\\ __Single Micrograph Mode - Process a single micrograph:__
\\ One can specify a single micrograph name using --selection_list option. In this mode, only the specified single micrograph will be processed. If this micrograph name does not matches the file name part of the pattern (ignoring the directory paths), the process will exit without processing it. If this micrograph name matches the file name part of the pattern but does not exists in the directory which specified by the micrograph path pattern, again the process will exit without processing it. Use single processor for this mode.

  sxcter.py './mic*.hdf' outdir_cter --selection_list=mic0.hdf --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0

\\ __Stack Mode - ProcessProcess a particle stack (Not supported by SPHIRE GUI)):__
\\ Use --stack_mode option, then specify the path of particle stack file (without wild card "*") and output directory as arguments. This mode ignores --selection_list, --wn --overlap_x, --overlap_y, --edge_x, and --edge_y options. Use single processor for this mode. Not supported by SPHIRE GUI (sxgui.py). 

  sxcter.py bdb:stack outdir_cter --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --stack_mode

\\ __All Micrographs Mode with Phase-Shift Estimation:__
\\ defocus_min, defocus_max, defocus_step, phase_min, phase_max, and phase_step options are only applicable with --vpp option.

  mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py './mic*.hdf' outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --vpp --defocus_min=0.3 --defocus_max=9.0 --defocus_step=0.1 --phase_min=5.0 --phase_max=175.0 --phase_step=5

\\ __All Micrographs Mode with the CTF model fitting to power spectrum:__

  mpirun -np 16 sxcter.py './mic*.hdf' outdir_cter --wn=512 --apix=2.29 --Cs=2.0 --voltage=300 --ac=10.0 --pap
