sxviper - Initial 3D Model - VIPER: ''ab initio'' 3D structure determination using Validation of Individual Parameter Reproducibility (VIPER). Designed to determine a validated initial model using a small set of class averages produced by [[sxisac|ISAC]].

= Usage =


''usage in command line''

sxviper.py stack  directory  --ir=inner_radius --radius=outer_radius --rs=ring_step --xr=x_range --yr=y_range --mask3D=mask3D --moon_elimination=moon_elimination --ts=translational_search_step  --delta=angular_step --center=center_type --maxit1=max_iter1 --maxit2=max_iter2 --L2threshold=0.1 --ref_a=S --sym=c1 --nruns=nruns --doga=doga --fl=fl --aa=aa --pwreference=pwreference --debug


=== Typical usage ===

sxrviper exists only in MPI version.

''' mpirun --npernode 16 -np 24 --host node1,node2 sxviper.py  stack output_directory --fl=0.25 --radius=30 --xr=2 --moon_elimination=750,4.84 '''

A fast track option, that can be used to choose parameters in the appropriate ranges (for example, obtaining adequate spatial frequency filtering '--fl') is provided below. Since it employs extreme values for some parameters this command can be used only for parameter tuning for the VIPER algorithm. 

''' mpirun --npernode 16 -np 16 --host node1 sxviper.py  stack output_directory --fl=0.25 --radius=30 --xr=1 --nruns=2   --L2threshold=1.0e300  --doga=-1'''

The VIPER program needs MPI environment to work properly. Number of used MPI processes MUST BE a multiple of --nruns (default = 6). 

Since VIPER makes use of group of processors working together, it is important from a time efficiency point of view to have processors within a group being allocated on the same node. This way any data exchange within the group does not use network traffic. The "--npernode" option of mpirun is useful in accomplishing this goal. As shown in the example below when "--npernode" is used  mpi allocates the ranks of the processors sequentially, not moving to the next node until the current one is filled.  If "--npernode" is not used then processors are allocated in a round robin fashion (i.e. jumping to the next node with each allocation). Since in VIPER, groups contain consecutively ranked processors, it is important to provide  "--npernode XX" where XX is the number of processors per node.

== Input ==
    stack:: Input images stack: A small set of Class averages produced by ISAC. (default required string)

    radius:: Target particle radius [Pixels]: Use the same value as in ISAC. It has to be less than half the box size. (default required int)
    sym:: Point-group symmetry: (default c1)

    * The remaining parameters are optional.
    xr:: X search range [Pixels]: The translational search range in the x direction will take place in a +/xr range. (default '0')
    yr:: Y search range [Pixels]: The translational search range in the y direction. If omitted it will be xr. (default '0')
    mask3D:: 3D mask: (default sphere)
    moon_elimination:: Eliminate disconnected regions: Used to removed disconnected pieces from the model. It requires as argument a comma separated string with the mass in KDa and the pixel size. (default none)

    ir:: Inner rotational search radius [Pixels]: (default 1)
    rs:: Ring step size: Step between rings used for the rotational search. (default 1)
    ts:: Translational search step [Pixels]: The search will be performed in -xr, -xr+ts, 0, xr-ts, xr, can be fractional. (default '1.0')
    delta::  Projection angular step [Degree]: (default '2.0')
    center:: Center 3D template: 0: no centering; 1: center of gravity (default -1.0)
    maxit1:: Maximum iterations - GA step: (default 400)
    maxit2:: Maximum iterations - Finish step: (default 50)
    L2threshold:: GA stop threshold: Defines the maximum relative dispersion of volumes' L2 norms. (default 0.03)
    ref_a:: Projection generation method: Method for generating the quasi-uniformly distributed projection directions. S- Saff algorithm, or P - Penczek 1994 algorithm. (default S)
    nruns:: GA population size: This defines the number of quasi-independent volumes generated. (default 6)
    doga:: Threshold to start GA: Do GA when the fraction of orientation that changes less than 1.0 degrees is at least this fraction. (default 0.1)
    fl:: Low-pass filter frequency [1/Pixel]: Using a hyperbolic tangent low-pass filter. (default 0.25)
    aa:: Low-pass filter fall-off: Fall-off of for the hyperbolic tangent low-pass filter. (default 0.1)
    pwreference:: Power spectrum reference: Text file containing a 1D reference power spectrum. (default none)
    debug:: Verbose: Print debug info. (default False)


== Output ==
    directory:: Output directory: The directory will be automatically created and the results will be written here. If the directory already exists, results will be written there, possibly overwriting previous runs. (default required string)


= Description =
 * This program uses a user defined projection angle and translation shift to perform 3D reconstruction. The translation shifts, and step are not limited to integer number. For a given delta, the program will perform maxit round refinement. So the final refinement iteration is maxit*(number of delta values) 
 * For the program to work, attributes xform.projection (Transform object containing three Euler angles and two in-plane shifts) have to be set in the header of each file.  If their values are not known, all should be set to zero.  
 * The program will start alignment from the current alignment parameters xform.projection stored in file headers. 
 * The program only change the alignment parameters in their header. The images in stack keep untouched. ( Neither rotated nor shifted. )
