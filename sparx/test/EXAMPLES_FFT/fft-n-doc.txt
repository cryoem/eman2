   Here is a nice split-radix, N-dimensional, fast-fourier transform
   by R. C. Singleton (Stanford Research Institute, Sept. 1968)
   which has been converted into C code (7/26/95 by John Beale).

   My very casual tests show this code is significantly faster than the
   Numerical Recipes fourn() routine (25 vs. 36 seconds for a (1024x1024)
   floating point matrix). Also, this code is freely redistributable!

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------

   Started a minor clean-up of the Fortran-66 code to make it closer to
   Fortran-77 and added comments to help mark-up the logical structure and
   then re-did the f2c conversion.  There is still a Fortran look to some of
   the code especially with incrementing a counter and then subtracting 1
   for an array subscript, but most compilers should optimize around that
   and it's best not to fiddle with too many things.  I've cleaned-up most
   of the goto/label spaghetti so that the resulting code is actually
   recognizable C compared to what f2c produced.

   Added the wrapper function fftn() to remove the hassle of using
   fftradix() directly.  You MUST call fft_free() to free-up allocated
   memory.

   Note that the file re-includes itself with different defines so that the
   both float and double precision version may compiled together.

   Don't want the double version?	define FFT_NODOUBLE
   Don't want the float version?	define FFT_NOFLOAT
   Don't want odd radix transforms?	define FFT_RADIX4

   The suffix `f' indicates a float vs. double version.

   Made fftradix() a local (static) function since fftn() should be used
   instead.

   TODO:
   - someone should take a look at getting `max_factors' and `max_perm'
     calculated correctly in fftn()

 *
 * Revisions:
 * 26 July 95	John Beale
 *	- added maxf and maxp as parameters to fftradix()
 *
 * 28 July 95	Mark Olesen <olesen@me.queensu.ca>
 *	- cleaned-up the Fortran 66 goto spaghetti, only 3 labels remain.
 *
 *	- added fft_free() to provide some measure of control over
 *	  allocation/deallocation.
 *
 *	- added fftn() wrapper for multidimensional FFTs
 *
 *	- use -DFFT_NOFLOAT or -DFFT_NODOUBLE to avoid compiling that
 *	  precision. Note suffix `f' on the function names indicates
 *	  float precision.
 *
 *	- revised documentation
 *
 * 31 July 95	Mark Olesen <olesen@me.queensu.ca>
 *	- added GNU Public License
 *	- more cleanup
 *	- define SUN_BROKEN_REALLOC to use malloc() instead of realloc()
 *	  on the first pass through, apparently needed for old libc
 *	- removed #error directive in favour of some code that simply
 *	  won't compile (generate an error that way)
 *
 * 1 Aug 95	Mark Olesen <olesen@me.queensu.ca>
 *	- define FFT_RADIX4 to only have radix 2, radix 4 transforms
 *	- made fftradix /fftradixf () static scope, just use fftn()
 *	  instead.  If you have good ideas about fixing the factors
 *	  in fftn() please do so.
 *
 * 8 Jan 95	mj olesen <olesen@me.queensu.ca>
 *	- fixed typo's, including one that broke scaling for scaling by
 *	  total number of matrix elements or the square root of same
 *	- removed unnecessary casts from allocations

 * int fftn (int ndim, const int dims[], REAL Re[], REAL Im[],
 *	    int iSign, double scaling);
 *
 * NDIM = the total number dimensions
 * DIMS = a vector of array sizes
 *	if NDIM is zero then DIMS must be zero-terminated
 *
 * RE and IM hold the real and imaginary components of the data, and return
 * the resulting real and imaginary Fourier coefficients.  Multidimensional
 * data *must* be allocated contiguously.  There is no limit on the number
 * of dimensions.
 *
 * ISIGN = the sign of the complex exponential (ie, forward or inverse FFT)
 *	the magnitude of ISIGN (normally 1) is used to determine the
 *	correct indexing increment (see below).
 *
 * SCALING = normalizing constant by which the final result is *divided*
 *	if SCALING == -1, normalize by total dimension of the transform
 *	if SCALING <  -1, normalize by the square-root of the total dimension
 *
 * example:
 * tri-variate transform with Re[n1][n2][n3], Im[n1][n2][n3]
 *
 *	int dims[3] = {n1,n2,n3}
 *	fftn (3, dims, Re, Im, 1, scaling);

 * int fftradix (REAL Re[], REAL Im[], size_t nTotal, size_t nPass,
 *		 size_t nSpan, int iSign, size_t max_factors,
 *		 size_t max_perm);
 *
 * RE, IM - see above documentation
 *
 * Although there is no limit on the number of dimensions, fftradix() must
 * be called once for each dimension, but the calls may be in any order.
 *
 * NTOTAL = the total number of complex data values
 * NPASS  = the dimension of the current variable
 * NSPAN/NPASS = the spacing of consecutive data values while indexing the
 *	current variable
 * ISIGN - see above documentation
 *
 * example:
 * tri-variate transform with Re[n1][n2][n3], Im[n1][n2][n3]
 *
 *	fftradix (Re, Im, n1*n2*n3, n1,       n1, 1, maxf, maxp);
 *	fftradix (Re, Im, n1*n2*n3, n2,    n1*n2, 1, maxf, maxp);
 *	fftradix (Re, Im, n1*n2*n3, n3, n1*n2*n3, 1, maxf, maxp);
 *
 * single-variate transform,
 *    NTOTAL = N = NSPAN = (number of complex data values),
 *
 *	fftradix (Re, Im, n, n, n, 1, maxf, maxp);
 *
 * The data can also be stored in a single array with alternating real and
 * imaginary parts, the magnitude of ISIGN is changed to 2 to give correct
 * indexing increment, and data [0] and data [1] used to pass the initial
 * addresses for the sequences of real and imaginary values,
 *
 * example:
 *	REAL data [2*NTOTAL];
 *	fftradix ( &data[0], &data[1], NTOTAL, nPass, nSpan, 2, maxf, maxp);
 *
 * for temporary allocation:
 *
 * MAX_FACTORS	>= the maximum prime factor of NPASS
 * MAX_PERM	>= the number of prime factors of NPASS.  In addition,
 *	if the square-free portion K of NPASS has two or more prime
 *	factors, then MAX_PERM >= (K-1)
 *
 * storage in FACTOR for a maximum of 15 prime factors of NPASS. if NPASS
 * has more than one square-free factor, the product of the square-free
 * factors must be <= 210 array storage for maximum prime factor of 23 the
 * following two constants should agree with the array dimensions.
