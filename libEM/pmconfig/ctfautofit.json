    "INST":"This Wizard is to Help users from e2ctf in autofit mode. This program does the following: First it compute the foreground and background power. Background is defined as a circular region outside the particles. Next Fg-Bg sepctra are computed and used for fitting. First defocus is fit via least squares, then defcous and B factor are fit via simplex multidimensional miniziation using either a precomputed structure factor or the GroEL struccutre factors at high resolution domains. Finally all parameteres are refined using the simplex algorithm",
