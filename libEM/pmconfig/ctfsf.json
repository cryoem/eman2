This is achieved by simultaneously fitting multiple power spectra. You must simultaneously fit al test 3-4 power spectra otherwise the problem becomes underdetermined at your SF results will be ambiguous.",

After structure factor computation you can check the structure factors by plotting with the browser. strucfac.txt' contains the structure factors, and 'strucfac.allpoints.txt' contains the structure factors computed from all power spectra in the vicinity of the CTF peaks(regions of strongest signal).",
