This program is CUDA accelerated and if you have CUDA you can expect upto 20 fold speedup. This program is not yet parallized, but will be in the future.",

The number of class averages should be minimal as the dimensionality of this problem increases as ca number increases. Also choose the filename of the output 3D an initio model.",
