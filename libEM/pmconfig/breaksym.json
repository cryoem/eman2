    "INST":"This Wizard is to Help users run e2spt_classaverage in breaksym mode. Once subtomograms have been aligned using a symmetric search, it can be desirable to break the symmetry to find asymmetric features such as the tail of a virus. This seach takes particles that are prealigned to their symmetry axis, searches all symmetric positions and alignes based on the best score which should be where asymetric features line up(provided the have sufficient signal). This program is CUDA enabled",
