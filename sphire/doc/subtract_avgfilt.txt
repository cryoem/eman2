===== sp_signalsubtract avgfilt =====

Average and Filter : Average and low-pass filter a map for segmentation.

\\
===== Usage =====

Usage in command line

  	sp_signalsubtract.py avgfilt --avol1=map_to_average_1 --avol2=map_to_average_2 --outdir=output_subtraction_directory --apix=pixel_size --filtrad=filter_radius --verbosity=verbosity_level


\\
===== Typical usage =====

sp_signalsubtract comprises the steps needed to subtract masked regions from a map in order to focus on the remaining features from that map.  There are six steps for this process (five within SPHIRE):

\\ __1. Average and low-pass filter a map for segmentation __:

  sp_signalsubtract.py avgfilt --avol1=map_to_average_1 --avol2=map_to_average_2 --outdir=output_subtraction_directory --apix=pixel_size --filtrad=filter_radius

Generate a denoised map for segmentation.  The input map(s) can be postprocessed (i.e., sharpened, masked, etc.), but it is important that the final map that is masked below (in Step 4) is not postprocessed.  

Choose a low-pass filter radius so that a permissive (i.e., low) surface threshold can be used in Chimera.  If too high a threshold is used during segmentation, then the resulting mask may not encapsulate the entire region of interest.  If a low threshold is used on a not-post-processed high-resolution map, then disconnected "moon" densities will be included in the segmentation.
  
Note 1: If you already have an averaged map, or don't have two maps to average, skip the '--avol2' flag.

Note 2: Low-pass filter radius should be in units of Angstroms if pixel size (--apix) is provided.  If pixel size is not provided, then the program expects the filter radius in units of absolute frequency (px^-1)

\\ __2. Locate regions to be subtracted __

\\ __3. Mask a soft mask of the region to be excluded __

\\ __4. Compute re-projections of map to be subtracted, and subtract them from the original images __

\\ __5. Compute reconstruction of density remaining after signal-subtraction __

\\ __6. Center map of the remaining density __

  ; %%--%%outdir : Output directory : Directory where outputs will be written. (default required string)
  ; %%--%%filtrad : Filter radius : Low-pass filter radius. (default None) : subtraction_mode==avgfilt
  ; %%--%%apix : Pixel size : Pixel size in Angstroms. (default None)
  
\\
=== Advanced Parameters ===
  ; %%--%%verbosity : Verbosity level : Controls how much information will be written to the screen. (default 2)
  
\\
