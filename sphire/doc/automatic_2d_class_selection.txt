===== sp_cinderella_pred =====
Automatic 2D class selection: Classify classes into good and bad.

\\
===== Usage =====

Usage in command line

  sp_cinderella_pred.py cinderella_path inputstack output_dir model_path --confidence_threshold=CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD --gpu=GPU --batch_size=BATCH_SIZE

\\
===== Typical usage =====

-

\\
===== Input =====
=== Main Parameters ===
  ; cinderella_path : Cinderella predict executeable : Path to the sp_cinderella_predict.py in your Cinderella environment (default none)
  ; inputstack : Input stack : Path to your class stack (.mrcs/.hdf). (default none)
  ; output_dir : Output directory : Folder to write results. (default required string)
  ; model_path : Model path : Specifiy the path to your model file. (default required string)


\\
=== Advanced Parameters ===
  ; %%--%%confidence_threshold : Confidence threshold: Classes with a confidence higher as that threshold are classified as good.  (default 0.5)
  ; %%--%%gpu : GPU ID : ID of the GPU that should be used. (default -1)
  ; %%--%%batch_size : Number of batches : Number of mini-batches during prediction. (default 32)


\\
===== Output =====
It will write a .h5 file (default yolo_model.h5) into your project directory.


\\
===== Description =====
The training is divided into two parts. 1. Warmup: It prepares the network with a few epochs of training without actually estimating the size of the particle.
2. Actual training: The training will stop when the loss on the validation data stops to improve.
