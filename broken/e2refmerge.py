	THIS PROGRAM IS OBSOLETE

	This program is used by e2simmx2stage.py

	Given a stack of reference projections and a self similarity matrix, this program will find similar subsets of the references, align them
	to each other and average them together, producing a new, smaller, set of averaged projections suitable for preliminary classification of
	images. Classification of images is made based on image similarity, not projection geometry, so this should be a fairly reliable scheme for
	two-stage orientation determination. Each averaged projection will also contain metadata identifying which projections were used to produce
	it, and thus which should be checked in second-stage classification. This takes what is ordinarily an order n calculation and makes it an
	3.5*sqrt(3n) calculation."""
