######
# This module implements access to STAR files (includes files used by Relion 
# and other software, as well as CIF/MMCIF. It does not implement the full STAR specification.
# We do try to cover the CIF specification reasonably well, though:
# http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/spec/version1.1/cifsyntax
# 
# 
# The STAR file is represented as a dictionary-like abstraction of the physical file on disk. 
# Changes to the abstract object will be syncronized with the file when only explicitly requested.
# The entire file is kept in RAM, and the file is only re-read from disk if 'readfile()' is
# explicitly called (which will overwrite any changes in memory). 
#
# There is no support for schema, or constrained datatypes for values. Values may be int, float or string.
#
# The JSON file mechanism is  much more robust and greatly preferred for EMAN2 applications. 
# This module is mainly used for inter-software compatibility.
#
# keys have the leading "_" stripped off
#
# loop values are represented as a python list. keys from the same loop should have an identical number
# of elements. loops are identified internally as a list of lists (self.loop) independent of the
# actual data storage.
